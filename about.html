this website contains the names and thumbnails of tons and tons of makecode arcade projects, as well as a link to play them. You may be wondering, How did you find all these games? Well, I only put games that have been archived in the Internet Archive here, just because that is the best way for me to get a huge list of makecode arcade games. I downloaded the thumbnails and info for each project and put them here. You may also be wondering, Why does this not have every game? Well, there is no way for me to get a list of every share link ever created, makecode just doesn't work like that, and if I tried every single possible combination of link to get them all, that would take over 100000 years and i would probably be blocked by makecode anyway thanks to their rate limit.

This is not something that is actively updated, all of these games were made before June 16 2025

Most of these games are random ones, some have never been shared on the forum before, there are quite a bit of projects I made because I use the wayback machine browser extension.
